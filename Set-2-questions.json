        "question": "What is the primary reason SDS is added to a protein mixture before electrophoresis?",
        "options": [
            "To strengthen hydrogen bonds",
            "To prevent proteins from migrating",
            "To ensure separation is based solely on molecular weight",
            "To increase the variety of charges in the mixture"
        ],
        "answer": "To ensure separation is based solely on molecular weight",
        "explanation": "SDS nullifies intrinsic charges and gives all proteins a uniform negative charge-to-mass ratio."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which region of the SDS molecule is responsible for interacting with and unfolding the internal regions of proteins?",
        "options": [
            "The hydrophobic region",
            "The oxygen atoms",
            "The Sodium (Na+) ion",
            "The ionic region"
        ],
        "answer": "The hydrophobic region",
        "explanation": "The long carbon chain (hydrophobic region) interacts with and disrupts the hydrophobic core of the protein."
    },
    {
        "question": "What occurs when the protein sample is heated to approximately 95°C during preparation?",
        "options": [
            "The protein becomes more folded",
            "Hydrogen bonds are destroyed",
            "The overall charge becomes positive",
            "Ionic bonds are formed"
        ],
        "answer": "Hydrogen bonds are destroyed",
        "explanation": "Heating provides the energy required to destroy the hydrogen bonds that maintain the protein's secondary and tertiary structures."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the state of the protein after being heated and treated with SDS?",
        "options": [
            "Alpha helix",
            "3D globular structure",
            "Linearized polypeptide chain",
            "Uncharged amino acid sequence"
        ],
        "answer": "Linearized polypeptide chain",
        "explanation": "The combination of heat and SDS results in a fully denatured, linearized polypeptide chain coated in negative charges."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which electrode do proteins migrate toward after SDS treatment?",
        "options": [
            "The negative electrode (cathode)",
            "The electrode with the same charge as the protein",
            "They remain stationary",
            "The positive electrode (anode)"
        ],
        "answer": "The positive electrode (anode)",
        "explanation": "Since SDS confers a uniform negative charge, proteins are attracted to the positive electrode, which is the anode."
