    "options": [
      "1:35",
      "37.5:1",
      "10:1",
      "1:1"

    "question": "What is the primary function of the Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.8) in the resolving gel?",
    "options": [
      "To accelerate the formation of free radicals",
      "To maintain an alkaline pH optimal for separation",
      "To denature the proteins",
      "To impart a negative charge to the proteins"
    ],
    "answer": "To maintain an alkaline pH optimal for separation",
    "explanation": "The pH 8.8 environment provided by Tris-HCl is essential for the specific protein migration conditions of the resolving gel."

  {
    "question": "What structural feature of 'Activated Acrylamide' allows it to form long polymer chains?",
    "options": [
      "The amide group ($NH_{2}$)",
      "The Carbonyl group ($C = O$)",
      "The double bond ($CH_{2} = CH$)"
    ],
    "answer": "The double bond ($CH_{2} = CH$)",
    "explanation": "The carbon-carbon double bond allows the monomers to link together into long chains during polymerization."

  {
    "question": "Which component in the resolving gel mix is an anionic detergent that denatures proteins and provides them with a uniform negative charge?",
    "options": [
      "Bis-acrylamide",
      "APS",
      "SDS (Sodium dodecyl sulfate)",
      "Tris-HCl"
    ],
    "answer": "SDS (Sodium dodecyl sulfate)",
    "explanation": "SDS is the anionic detergent that unfolds proteins and coats them with a negative charge proportional to their mass."
  },
  {
    "question": "What structural change occurs to the acrylamide monomer to allow it to link into long polyacrylamide chains?",
    "options": [
      "The carbonyl group ($C = O$) breaks apart.",
      "The double bond ($CH_2 = CH$) opens to form single bonds with other monomers.",
      "The monomer binds to Tris-HCl molecules.",
      "The amide group ($NH_2$) is removed."
    ],
    "answer": "The double bond ($CH_2 = CH$) opens to form single bonds with other monomers.",
    "explanation": "Polymerization occurs through the opening of the carbon-carbon double bond, allowing new covalent bonds to form with adjacent monomers."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it common practice to purchase acrylamide in pre-mixed liquid solutions rather than as a raw powder?",
    "options": [
      "The powder form is highly toxic and dangerous to handle.",
      "To increase the speed of the polymerization reaction.",
      "The powder form cannot be cross-linked by bis-acrylamide.",
      "The liquid form has a higher pH of 8.8 automatically."
    ],
    "answer": "The powder form is highly toxic and dangerous to handle.",
    "explanation": "Acrylamide powder is a neurotoxin; using liquid solutions minimizes the risk of accidental inhalation."

  {
    "question": "If a researcher intends to separate very small proteins, which adjustment to the gel composition is necessary?",
    "options": [
      "Change the pH from 8.8 to 6.8.",
      "Increase the acrylamide percentage to create smaller pores.",
      "Decrease the acrylamide percentage to create larger pores.",
      "Remove the bis-acrylamide cross-linker."
    ],
    "answer": "Increase the acrylamide percentage to create smaller pores.",
    "explanation": "A higher density of polyacrylamide chains creates a tighter mesh, which provides better resolution for small molecules."

  {
    "question": "True or False: Acrylamide can form a solid, functional electrophoresis gel matrix without the presence of bis-acrylamide.",
    "options": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "answer": "False",
    "explanation": "Bis-acrylamide is essential because it acts as a bridge between acrylamide chains, creating the 3D network required for a gel."
