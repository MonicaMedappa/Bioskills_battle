    "question": "What is the primary reason for treating a gel with a fixative solution like methanol-acetic acid immediately after the run?",
    "options": [
      "To prevent the polypeptide bands from diffusing within the gel matrix",
      "To activate the dye molecules in the staining solution",
      "To increase the negative charge on the proteins",
      "To wash away the SDS from the gel surface"
    ],
    "answer": "To prevent the polypeptide bands from diffusing within the gel matrix",
    "explanation": "Fixing precipitates the proteins within the gel pores, locking them in place so they don't blur or wash away during staining."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the specific purpose of the 'destaining' step in the visualization process?",
    "options": [
      "To break the covalent bonds between the dye and the protein",
      "To prepare the gel for a second electrophoresis run",
      "To remove non-specific dye from the gel matrix to improve contrast",
      "To reduce the molecular weight of the proteins"
    ],
    "answer": "To remove non-specific dye from the gel matrix to improve contrast",
    "explanation": "Destaining removes the dye that has soaked into the gel background while leaving the dye bound to the proteins intact."

    "question": "Which downstream analytical technique often requires physical excision of the stained band from the gel?",
    "options": [
      "Centrifugation",
      "PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)",
      "pH titration",
      "Mass spectroscopy"
    ],
    "answer": "Mass spectroscopy",
    "explanation": "To identify a protein via mass spec, the specific band must be cut from the gel and digested into peptides."
  },
  {
    "question": "What would be the likely result of skipping the 'fixing' step and moving directly to staining?",
    "options": [
      "The protein bands would become blurred or disappear due to diffusion",
      "The gel would dissolve instantly",
      "The dye would turn from blue to red",
      "The proteins would gain a positive charge"
    ],
    "answer": "The protein bands would become blurred or disappear due to diffusion",
    "explanation": "Without fixation, the small protein molecules are free to migrate out of their bands and into the surrounding solution or gel."
