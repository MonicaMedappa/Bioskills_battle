    "question": "What is the primary function of SDS in protein electrophoresis?",
    "options": [
      "To increase the resistance of the gel matrix",
      "To catalyze the formation of disulfide bridges",
      "To provide a uniform negative charge proportional to length",
      "To stabilize the tertiary structure of the protein"
    ],
    "answer": "To provide a uniform negative charge proportional to length",
    "explanation": "Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) is an anionic detergent that denatures proteins and imparts a uniform negative charge-to-mass ratio, allowing separation based solely on molecular weight."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which chemical agents are specifically used to break disulfide bridges in a protein sample?",
    "options": [
      "BME or DTT",
      "Polyacrylamide polymers",
      "Sodium Lauryl Sulfate",
      "Acrylamide monomers"
    ],
    "answer": "BME or DTT",
    "explanation": "Beta-mercaptoethanol (BME) and Dithiothreitol (DTT) are reducing agents that break covalent disulfide bonds between cysteine residues, helping to fully linearize proteins."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the binding ratio of SDS to protein mass during sample preparation?",
    "options": [
      "1.0 gram of SDS per 1.4 grams of protein",
      "Variable ratio depending on amino acid sequence",
      "1.4 grams of SDS per gram of protein",
      "2.5 grams of SDS per gram of protein"
    ],
    "answer": "1.4 grams of SDS per gram of protein",
    "explanation": "SDS binds uniformly to the protein backbone at a specific constant ratio of approximately 1.4g of SDS for every 1g of protein."
  },
  {
    "question": "In a polyacrylamide gel, which proteins will migrate the fastest toward the anode?",
    "options": [
      "Proteins with a high positive charge",
      "Smaller proteins with shorter polypeptide chains",
      "Larger proteins with longer polypeptide chains",
      "Proteins that have retained their globular shape"
    ],
    "answer": "Smaller proteins with shorter polypeptide chains",
    "explanation": "Smaller molecules move more easily through the pores of the polyacrylamide mesh, allowing them to migrate faster toward the positive electrode (anode)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which amino acid is primarily responsible for forming the disulfide bridges that BME and DTT disrupt?",
    "options": [
      "Glycine",
      "Lysine",
      "Cysteine",
      "Leucine"
    ],
    "answer": "Cysteine",
    "explanation": "Cysteine contains a thiol (-SH) group in its side chain that can form covalent disulfide bonds with other cysteine residues to stabilize protein structure."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the polyacrylamide gel matrix facilitate the separation of proteins?",
    "options": [
      "It acts as a chemical catalyst to speed up migration",
      "It forms a mesh-like sieve that separates proteins by size",
      "It provides the negative charge needed for movement",
      "It breaks the non-covalent bonds of the proteins"
    ],
    "answer": "It forms a mesh-like sieve that separates proteins by size",
    "explanation": "The gel matrix acts as a molecular sieve; as proteins are pulled through by an electric field, the mesh-like structure hinders larger molecules more than smaller ones."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the effect of SDS on the non-covalent bonds of a protein?",
    "options": [
      "It disrupts them to help unfold the protein",
      "It strengthens them to prevent denaturation",
      "It has no effect on non-covalent interactions",
      "It converts them into covalent disulfide bonds"
    ],
    "answer": "It disrupts them to help unfold the protein",
    "explanation": "By breaking non-covalent bonds, SDS helps convert folded proteins into linear chains, which is essential for uniform denaturation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What factor is largely eliminated by using SDS and polyacrylamide gel in electrophoresis?",
    "options": [
      "The need for an electric field",
      "The presence of amino acids",
      "The influence of native structure and charge",
      "The mass of the protein"
    ],
    "answer": "The influence of native structure and charge",
    "explanation": "SDS masks the native charge and unfolds the structure, leaving size (molecular weight) as the primary factor for separation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following describes the state of proteins after treatment with SDS and BME?",
    "options": [
      "Folded and positively charged",
      "Branched chains with intact covalent bridges",
      "Globular and neutrally charged",
      "Unfolded linear chains with a negative charge"
    ],
    "answer": "Unfolded linear chains with a negative charge",
    "explanation": "The combination of SDS (charge and denaturation) and BME (reduction of disulfide bridges) results in fully unfolded, negatively charged linear polypeptide chains."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is the migration of proteins in SDS-PAGE said to be based on 'polypeptide chain length'?",
    "options": [
      "Because reducing agents increase the length of the chain",
      "Because all proteins are the same weight",
      "Because the charge-to-mass ratio is made uniform",
      "Because the gel matrix only allows certain lengths to pass"
    ],
    "answer": "Because the charge-to-mass ratio is made uniform",
    "explanation": "By binding SDS at a constant ratio, the only variable affecting migration speed through the gel is the length of the chain, as the charge-to-mass ratio is consistent across different proteins."
