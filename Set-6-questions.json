     "question": "If an SDS-PAGE gel reveals additional bands at a lower molecular weight than the expected target, which factor is the most likely cause?",
     "options": [ 
      "Incomplete protein denaturation",
      "Protease activity in the sample",
      "High glycerol concentration",
      "Formation of protein multimers"
     ],
     "answer": "Protease activity in the sample",
     "explanation": "Enzymatic cleavage of the target protein into smaller fragments results in the appearance of lower molecular weight bands."
  },
  {
     "question": "What is the specific role of glycerol in the protein loading buffer?",
     "options": [
      "Buffering the pH during the electrophoresis run",
      "Increasing sample density to ensure it sinks into the well",
      "Reducing disulfide bonds between cysteine residues",
      "Coating proteins with a uniform negative charge"
     ],
     "answer": "Increasing sample density to ensure it sinks into the well",
     "explanation": "Glycerol makes the sample heavier than the surrounding running buffer, preventing it from floating out during loading."
  },
  {
     "question": "Which of the following is a common result of incomplete reduction of disulfide bonds?",
     "options": [
      "Sample leakage into adjacent wells",
      "Presence of protein dimers or aggregates",
      "Complete loss of protein signal",
      "The appearance of blurred 'smiley' bands"
  ],
    "answer": "Presence of protein dimers or aggregates",
    "explanation": "If disulfide bridges remain intact, multiple protein chains stay linked, creating higher molecular weight structures."
  },
  {
    "question": "When an immunoblot shows unexpected 'artifact' bands that are not present in a standard stained gel, what is the most likely culprit?",
    "options": [
    "Non-specific antibody binding",
    "Excessive protein loading",
    "Depleted running buffer",
    "Insufficient glycerol"
  ],
    "answer": "Non-specific antibody binding",
    "explanation": "In Western blotting, antibodies may bind to proteins other than the target, creating signals that don't represent the actual protein concentration."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, typically manifest on an SDS-PAGE gel?",
    "options": [
     "By preventing the protein from entering the stacking gel",
     "As a sharp band at a much lower molecular weight",
     "By neutralizing the negative charge provided by SDS",
     "As multiple bands or a slight shift in migration"
  ],
    "answer": "As multiple bands or a slight shift in migration",
    "explanation": "Adding groups like sugars or phosphates changes the protein's mass, leading to different migration speeds."
  }, 
  {
     "question": "Which running condition is most likely to cause band distortion due to heat generation?",
     "options": [
      "Freshly prepared running buffer",
      "Loading the maximum volume in a well",
      "Excessively high voltage",
      "Running the gel at 4°C"
    ],
     "answer": "Excessively high voltage",
     "explanation": "High voltage increases the current, which generates heat and can warp the gel or distort the bands."
  },
  {
    "question": "A researcher observes that their protein sample is floating out of the well and into the running buffer. What should they check first?",
    "options": [
      "The presence of protease inhibitors",
      "The glycerol concentration in the loading dye",
      "The voltage of the power supply",
      "The temperature of the denaturation step"
    ],
     "answer": "The glycerol concentration in the loading dye",
     "explanation": "Inadequate glycerol results in a sample that is not dense enough to stay at the bottom of the well."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary risk of 'sample overload' in an electrophoresis well?",
    "options": [
      "Increased glycosylation of the protein",
      "Spontaneous reduction of disulfide bonds",
      "Protein clumping and smeared bands",
      "Chemical degradation of the running buffer"
    ],
    "answer": "Protein clumping and smeared bands",
    "explanation": "Excess protein can aggregate or overwhelm the gel matrix, leading to a loss of resolution and broad smears."
  },
  {
   "question": "True or False: Using fresh buffers and appropriate salt concentrations can help prevent the formation of extra bands.",
    "options": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "answer": "True",
    "explanation": "Proper buffer conditions are essential for maintaining stable pH and conductivity, which prevents migration artifacts."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following is a preventative measure to avoid 'ghost' or 'extra' bands caused by protein isoforms?",
    "options": [
      "Understanding the biological variations of the target protein",
      "Increasing the voltage significantly",
      "Eliminating the reduction step",
      "Removing all glycerol from the buffer"
    ],
    "answer": "Understanding the biological variations of the target protein",
    "explanation": "Isoforms are natural biological variations; they aren't 'fixed' by prep but must be recognized as legitimate signals."
