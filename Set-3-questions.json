    "question": "In a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis setup, what is the specific physical mechanism that allows for the separation of proteins by size?",
    "options": [
      "The different electrical charges of the proteins cause them to move at different speeds.",
      "Staining with silver or Coomassie Brilliant Blue causes smaller proteins to move faster.",
      "The gel matrix acts as a molecular sieve, offering more resistance to larger proteins.",
      "The anode repels smaller proteins more effectively than larger ones."
    ],
    "answer": "The gel matrix acts as a molecular sieve, offering more resistance to larger proteins.",
    "explanation": "Smaller proteins navigate through the pores of the polyacrylamide matrix more easily than larger proteins, which are slowed down by the sieve-like structure."

    "question": "Based on the standard guidelines for gel concentration, which percentage should be used to best resolve a very large protein exceeding 200 kDa?",
    "options": [
      "7.5%",
      "5%",
      "12%",
      "20%"
    ],
    "answer": "5%",
    "explanation": "Lower gel percentages create larger pores, allowing very large proteins to enter and migrate through the matrix for better resolution."
  },
  {
    "question": "At the anode during electrophoresis, which electrochemical process occurs as anions migrate toward it?",
    "options": [
      "Ionization, where neutral molecules become anions.",
      "Oxidation, where the substance loses electrons to the electrode.",
      "Reduction, where the electrode loses electrons to the substance.",
      "Electrophoresis, which only involves the movement of ions without chemical reactions."
    ],
    "answer": "Oxidation, where the substance loses electrons to the electrode.",
    "explanation": "The anode is defined as the electrode where oxidation occurs; anions lose electrons as they reach the positive terminal."

  {
    "question": "When working with a sample containing a wide size range of proteins from 15 kDa to 250 kDa, why might a gradient gel be preferred over a single-percentage gel?",
    "options": [
      "It eliminates the need for post-electrophoresis staining methods.",
      "It ensures that all proteins reach the anode at the exact same time.",
      "It provides a varying pore size that can resolve both very small and very large proteins simultaneously.",
      "It converts larger proteins into smaller anions through oxidation."
    ],
    "answer": "It provides a varying pore size that can resolve both very small and very large proteins simultaneously.",
    "explanation": "Gradient gels increase in concentration from top to bottom, providing large pores for big proteins at the start and smaller pores for tiny proteins further down."
  },
  {
    "question": "If you are using a 10% polyacrylamide gel, which protein molecular weight range are you most likely trying to optimize for?",
    "options": [
      "15 — 100 kDa",
      "4 — 40 kDa",
      "25 — 200 kDa",
      "Above 250 kDa"
    ],
    "answer": "15 — 100 kDa",
    "explanation": "According to the data, a 10% gel is the optimal concentration for resolving proteins within the 15 to 100 kDa range."
