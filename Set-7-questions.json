    "question": "Can recombinant bacterial cells perform post-translational modifications (PTMs) on expressed proteins?",
    "options": [
      "Yes, but they are generally less complex than eukaryotic PTMs",
      "No, they only produce linear primary structures",
      "Yes, they perform complex glycosylation identically to human cells",
      "No, bacteria lack the machinery for any modifications"
    ],
    "answer": "Yes, but they are generally less complex than eukaryotic PTMs",
    "explanation": "While bacteria can perform modifications like lipidation or acetylation, they lack the sophisticated systems for complex glycosylation found in eukaryotes."

    "question": "Which of the following modifications is a bacterial cell capable of performing?",
    "options": [
      "Splicing of introns",
      "Phosphorylation and acetylation",
      "Complex N-linked glycosylation",

    "question": "What is the primary reason for using reducing agents like DTT or BME in sample preparation for SDS-PAGE?",
    "options": [
      "To increase the negative charge on proteins",
      "To break disulfide bonds and prevent aggregation",
      "To enhance the binding of SDS to the protein",
      "To stabilize the tertiary structure of proteins"
    ],
    "answer": "To break disulfide bonds and prevent aggregation",
    "explanation": "DTT and BME are reducing agents that break disulfide bonds between cysteine residues, preventing protein aggregation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might a researcher choose an alternative host over a standard bacterial strain for producing a biopharmaceutical?",
        "options": [
          "To achieve specific eukaryotic-like glycosylation",
          "Because bacteria cannot produce linear proteins",
          "To prevent all post-translational modifications",
          "To avoid the use of DTT and BME"
        ],
        "answer": "To achieve specific eukaryotic-like glycosylation",
        "explanation": "Since bacteria often fail to perform complex glycosylation, eukaryotic hosts are used when that modification is essential for the drug's function."
