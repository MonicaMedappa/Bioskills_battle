    "question": "Which two gases are primarily responsible for the bubbling observed during electrophoresis?",
    "options": [
      "Water vapor and Ozone",
      "Hydrogen (H₂) and Oxygen (O₂)",
      "Chlorine and Helium",
      "CO₂ and Nitrogen"
    ],
    "answer": "Hydrogen (H⁺) and Oxygen (O₂)",
    "explanation": "The electrolysis of water in the running buffer produces hydrogen gas at the cathode and oxygen gas at the anode."
  },
  {
    "question": "What occurs at the negatively charged cathode to generate gas?",
    "options": [
      "Protein molecules are converted into gas.",
      "Oxygen ions lose electrons to become O₂ gas.",
      "Positively charged hydrogen ions become hydrogen gas.",
      "The buffer evaporates due to high heat."
    ],
    "answer": "Positively charged hydrogen ions become hydrogen gas.",
    "explanation": "At the cathode, reduction occurs where hydrogen ions H⁺ gain electrons to form H₂ gas."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is there typically a higher volume of bubbles at the cathode than at the anode?",
    "options": [
      "Because hydrogen is lighter than oxygen.",
      "The anode is made of a material that absorbs gas.",
      "The cathode is hotter than the anode.",
      "Because water contains two hydrogen atoms for every one oxygen atom."
    ],
    "answer": "Because water contains two hydrogen atoms for every one oxygen atom.",
    "explanation": "The stoichiometry of water electrolysis 2H₂O → 2H₂ + O₂ results in twice the molar volume of hydrogen gas compared to oxygen."
  },
  {
    "question": "At which electrode are electrons removed from water molecules, resulting in oxygen gas formation?",
    "options": [
      "The power supply itself",
      "Both electrodes equally",
      "The negatively charged cathode",
      "The positively charged anode"
    ],
    "answer": "The positively charged anode",
    "explanation": "Oxidation occurs at the anode, where electrons are removed from water molecules to produce oxygen gas and protons."
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of chemical reaction is responsible for the formation of gas in an electrophoresis tank?",
    "options": [
      "Acid-base neutralization",
      "Nuclear fission",
      "Redox (reduction-oxidation) reaction",
      "Precipitation reaction"
    ],
    "answer": "Redox (reduction-oxidation) reaction",
    "explanation": "Electrolysis is a redox process where oxidation happens at the anode and reduction happens at the cathode simultaneously."
